# Predicting-the-Early-Stages-of-Alzheimers-Disease-Part-2
 To provide a complete pipeline to develop a deep learning model. More specifically, deep learning for computer vision (2D). Using a multiclass image classification (single label) deep learning model that can predict what stage (refer below) of Alzheimer's a patient is, from their MRI image.  This study will focus on CNN Verus DCGAN (Generative)
